  considered equivalent to the english 'A', and vice versa.
* fixed a bug where remote library ports greater than 32767 caused the app to
  crash.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.94.0

* added support for remote libraries (i.e connecting to a musikcube app or
  daemon running on a different machine) to the terminal client:
  - updated nearly all queries against the database in the app to be
    asynchronous. this was not necessary before because most local DB queries
    are extremely fast; however, when queries are sent over the network that may
    not be the case. there are still a small handful of queries made on the UI
    thread, but all of the really egregious ones have been fixed.
  - added a new `ISerializableQuery` interface that defines how a query can be
    serialized and deserialized. all queries now implement this interface.
  - defined a new `SendRawQuery` method to `IMetadataProxy` that is used by the
    server to send serialized queries to `musikcore`, and then respond with
    serialized results to the calling client.
  - added `WebSocketClient` that is used to connect to a `musikcube` server and
    authenticate. it takes serialized queries from the client and sends them to
    the server, then parses responses and unpacks the serialized result.
  - added a new `RemoteLibrary` implementation of `ILibrary`. it serializes
    queries and sends them to the server via `WebSocketClient`. once complete,
    `WebSocketClient` hands the serialized result back to `RemoteLibrary`, which
    then deserializes the result into the original query and notifies the caller.
  - added `MasterLibrary` in the same vein as `MasterTransport`. it's more a
    less a `pimpl` that allows us to switch the selected library under the hood
    without a majority of the app knowing or caring.
  - revamped the settings screen to allow selecting between local and remote
    libraries.
  - added a new screen that is displayed when a remote library is disconnected,
    and shows some diagnostic information.
  - added a new banner on the top of the app when connected to a remote library.
  - added buffering states to Stream/Transport/PlaybackService and friends.
  - updated the transport window to display buffering status when appropriate.
* fixed a number of bugs in `cursespp` related to nested layout focusing.
* fixed buggy visibility change events in `cursespp::Window` and removed old
  hacked-up code that was working around the problems in the app layer.

* found and fixed a handful of bugs in `HttpDataStream` that have been laying
  dormant, waiting to be exercised.
* fixed bugs related to `LruDiskCache` parsing and pruning.

  formats were fine)
* rearranged the settings window to ensure everything fits properly in an 80x24
  terminal
* fixed some bugs in `MessageQueue` by now requiring explicit `IMessageTarget`
  registration and unregistration for all messages. there was a small time
  window (read: race condition) where it was possible to attempt to dispatch
  messages to a destroyed target.
* fixed a handful of components that were running their initial queries twice
  or more as they were being initialized.
* updated copyright date across all source files
* upgraded a number of tools and dependencies:
  - migrated to VS2019 for Windows musikcube builds
  - migrated to Android Studio 4.1 for musikdroid builds
  - upgraded `websocketpp` and `json.hpp` and moved them out of `src/plugins`
    and into `src/3rdparty` so they can be used by the main app.
  - upgraded to boost 1.74.0
  - upgraded to openssl 1.1.1h
* fixed a bug in the indexer that could prevent custom sources from getting
  interrupted correctly.
* fixed a bug in libmicrothttpd version detection.
* fixed a bug where switching to a different output device while paused would
  cause playback to resume.

  this completes most work required to support external, thin clients.
  metadata can be queried via websocket, audio streamed over http. powered by
  libmicrohttpd.

  be played over http/https!
* performance optimizations to metadata indexing -- drop indexes before a full
  resync, then re-add them after.

  interface to add/remove/update track info with the main app
* added IIndexerNotifier: interface used to notify the app that it needs
  to be re-indexed.
* added "source_id" , "external_id", and "visible" column to the tracks
  table, with appropriate indexes.
* fixed a really old indexer bug where the reported number of file scanned
  was not accurate. Strange this wasn't noticed before.
* added "SetIndexerNotifier" injection method
* fixed a bug in TrackMetadataQuery -- it was unnecessarily relying upon
  the paths table, which was causing query errors when the table was
  empty.
* use a cache for local file paths instead of requiring an async round
  trip when adding/removing
* remove use of manual "ANALYZE", it was causing strange performance
  degradation issues. Instead, move to a set of PRAGMAs that instructs
  sqlite to run these optimizations when necessary.
* updated ::GetInt32 and ::GetUint32 return types to be explicit as to play
  more nicely with clang -- may as well, we're updating the SDK version
  anyway.
* added a simple capabilities model to the playback infrastructure. This
  is used to detect whether or not streams can be prefetched. For example,
  CDDA cannot because of seek times while playing tracks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.10.2

* fixed clang 7.3 compile error (macOS mavericks should work again)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.10.1

user-facing:

* added the ability to select album name headers in track lists. doing so will
  bring up a context menu with the ability to jump to the album or enqueue the
  album's tracks for playback. this also had a nice side effect of making
  scrolling more fluid!
* added jumping to album/artist/genre to the selected track context menu
* fixed a really old bug that could cause lists to automatically scroll to weird
  places if the window or view is resized
* directory browser now remembers which directories were previously selected,
  making up navigation in the settings view smoother
* added a "list_header_highlighted_background" and
  "list_header_highlighted_foreground" color theme variables
* tweaked the win32 icon so it looks a bit better on the taskbar

low-level:

* added "broadcast" message support to IMessageQueue and implementers. allows
  for pub/sub like functionality
* added some new SDK interface methods to ITrack and IMetadataMap for retrieving
  values other than strings (uint64, int64, uint32, int32, double)
* added localization support for "dimensions". this allows for per-locale sizing
  of ui components
* fixed some old bugs in Window.cpp that could cause visibility changed
  notifications to be raised unnecessarily
* added a custom PDCurses/win32a patch to further reduce CPU load and context
  switching while draining the message pump

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.10.0

* added GeekShadow's fr_FR locale
* fixed a bug in locale loading
* fixed a bug in nomad decoder if file load fails
* updated `Player` <-> `Stream` interaction so it's possible to interrupt long,
  blocking reads (e.g. if an http stream loader existed)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.9.5

* added localization support
* added support for user-defined themes (solarized dark and light included as
  examples)
* patched PDCurses/win32a to support the standard *nix 256 color palette

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.9.4

* added a "syncing metadata" banner that is displayed while the indexer is
  scanning metadata
* added a "sync metadata on startup" option to the settings view
* moved the hotkey tester to its own dedicated dialog to free up some valuable
  screen real estate in the settings view
* fixed `PulseOut` plugin volume adjustment to work better across a wider
  range of audio cards. this should also improve crossfade quality
* fixed a very old bug that was sometimes causing delayed redraws or flickering
  during layout in complex views

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.9.3

win32 only release:

* updated `WASAPI` output plugin to disable endpoint routing by default. it
  causes a crash in some rare cases that i don't seem to be able to work
  around. i see similar crashes in firefox and some other apps that use this
  feature.
* updated `DirectSound` output volume adjustment to be as close to the `WASAPI`
  `WaveOut` plugins as possible
* changed compiler optimizations to favor fast code, instead of small code,
  plus a few other small tweaks to (hopefully) improve performance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.9.2

* added an icon to the windows and android builds (not great, but better than
  nothing!)
* fixed a bug in the `nomad` (mp3) plugin where sample rate wasn't being
  handled appropriately. songs were sometimes playing too fast or slow.
* fixed a bug in the websockets plugin for certain metadata in locales that
  use commas instead of periods for decimal points
* added compression support to the `websocket_remote` plugin and the
  `musikdroid` android app
* fixed a crash when trying to manipulate an empty play queue in specific
  contexts
* fixed the win32 global volume up / volume down hotkeys to be consistent with
  the main app and `websocket_remote` behavior.
* changed data directory from "~/.mC2" to "~/.musikcube". the app will
  automatically perform this rename on startup.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.9.1

* added an app icon on win32 and android builds
* added proper support for using and switching between different audio sample
  formats. 24/192k works across all platforms now.
* fixed `DirectSoundOut` pause to work properly again
* added support for statically linking dependencies. for now we can supply
  macOS binaries that don't require homebrew! let's try to keep it that way.
* updated some defaults -- rescan metadata on startup by default, and restrict
  to two processing threads.
* fixed a crash when trying to change tracks in an empty playlist queue

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.9.0

user-facing:

* added new `musikdroid` android remote control! super useful with a Raspberry
  Pi. run musikbox in the background and control it from your phone.
* added a new `websocket_remote` plugin that allows any client capable of
  communciating with websockets the ability to control playback and query
  metadata!
* added settings UI for enabling/disabling plugins within the app!
* added more granular volume control when adjusting below 10%
* fixed a crash on shutdown while in track search view

low-level:

* added new sdk interfaces:
  - `ISimpleDataProvider`: can be used to query tracks, albums, artists, genres
  - `IMetadataValue` and `IMetadataValueList`: lists of metadata values and ids
  - `IMetadataMap` and `IMetadataMapList`: maps of values for resource ids
  - `IPreferences` for reading and writing preferences
* updated sdk interfaces:
  - `ITrack`: added `getId()`
  - `IPlaybackService`: the ability to modify or replace the play queue
  - `ITrackList`: added const correctness
  - renamed `IMetadataWriter` to `ITrackWriter`
* added the ability for plugins to register to receive `IPreferences` and
  `ISimpleDataProvider` interfaces via `SetPreferences()` and
  `SetSimpleDataProvider`, respectively. see `websocket_remote` for an example
* fixed up `PluginFactory` to store and provide more metadata about plugins
  when querying them.
* fixed a deadlock in `PlaybackService` when changing tracks from
  `IPlaybackRemote` plugins.
* fixed another WASAPI audio endpoint routing bug
* fixed some win32 project settings to allow profile guided optimizations (was
  broken for some plugins)
* fixed 'deprecated' compiler warnings on macOS
* seed the random number generator at startup

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.8.0

user-facing:

* added support for Raspberry Pi running Raspbian!
* added preliminary support for playlist editing. all editing is currently
  in the play queue view.
    - `ALT+s`: save the current play queue to a named playlist
    - `ALT+l`: load a previously saved playlist
    - `ALT+x`: delete a playlist
    - `ALT+r`: rename a playlist
* added the ability to delete (BACKSPACE on mac, DEL on win32/linux) and reorder
  (ALT+UP/ALT+DOWN win32/mac, CTRL+UP/CTRL+DOWN linux ) selected items in the
  play queue.
* added better color fallback for non-mutable 256 termianl color palettes
* added the ability to enqueue selected tracks, albums, artists, or other
  resources to the play queue by pressing ALT+ENTER.
* fixed a crash when trying to play a track that has been removed from the
  database
* fixed (maybe) an impossible-to-reproduce bug in PulseAudio where the output
  volume was not getting properly initialized
* removed "esc focuses shortcut bar" setting. no longer useful.

low-level:

* fixed cursespp child view coordinates to be relative to their parents
* cleaned up global focus model in cursespp
* added IPlaybackService::GetPlayingTrack() to get an IRetainedTrack pointer
  to the currently playing track; bumped SdkVersion to 2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.7.3

reduce CPU usage during playback in macOS CoreAudioOut
include the null output plugin in macOS and Linux builds.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.7.2

mostly performance and architecture changes:

* created new 'src/glue' package that contains code that can be optionally
  included and reused by other applications, but is too high-level for
  src/core
* cpu reduction and code simplification in 'Stream' and 'Player'
* cpu reduction in 'MessageQueue'
* reduced locking in 'Player' and 'MessageQueue'
* tweaked music library interface to optionally deliver results to a specified
  'IMessageQueue'
* moved 'PlaybackService' and 'TrackList' into 'core'
* optimized floating point sample scaling in the 'nomad' mp3 decoder
* reduced cpu overhead when redrawing the transport view
* added bare-bones, 'proof of concept' win32 application that includes 'core'
  and 'glue' to present a very basic music player in just a few lines of code.
* added a NullOut, an output plugin that doesn't write to the sound card. useful
  for development and testing purposes.

bug fixes:

* fixed default output plugin selection logic
* fixed a crash in WASAPI stream routing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.7.1

user-facing:

* fixed the flac decoder. oops.
* changed focus behavior in search view -- pressing return in the edit field
  will now focus the tracklist after starting playback
* added sdk and plugin versioning. the plugin loader will only load plugins
  with a supported version.

low-level

* removed pre-buffering code from Player, let Stream worry about that
* moved from boost to std for most threading (boost still used in the indexer)
* removed some unused boost dependencies from CMakeLists.txt
* various small optimizations to help reduce CPU overhead in MessageQueue and
  Player.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.7.0

a big release with lots of changes to low-level machinery.

user-facing:

* added a new "crossfade" playback mode that can be used instead of "gapless".
  users can change this functionality in the settings view.
* fixed audio artifacts in WasapiOut and DirectSoundOut when pausing and
  resuming playback multiple times very quickly.
* fixed a really bad bug where dialogs could not be easily dismissed in some
  cases. this included the first-run dialog! yikes.

low-level:

* added Latency() and Drain() methods to the IOutput interface
* reduced CPU load in some output plugins by being less aggressive about keeping
  the output buffers 100% full all the time. 75%+ fill rate should be
  sufficient.
* generalized MessageQueue and moved it out of app, and into core so it can be
  reused for other functionality (e.g. crossfading)
* added support for "mix points" in Player -- get a callback as soon as a
  specific playback position is hit!
* fixed DirectSoundOut to fall back to software mixing if hardware mixing is
  unavailable
* fixed DirectSoundOut to start playback immediately, instead of sometimes
  requiring the buffer to be completely full

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.6.2

* added a DirectSound output plugin for the win32 build.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.6.1

* replaced mpg123 decoder with MAD. gapless playback for a much wider variety of
  mp3s!
* optimized indexing process by maintaining an in-memory database id cache. uses
  a bit more memory (temporarily, during indexing) but improves indexing speed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.6.0

* added the ability to have multiple output plugins, and the ability switch
  between them in settings
* added a new default output plugin for win32 (WASAPI) and linux (PulseAudio)
* changed a bunch of low-level ui code to substantially reduce layout passes and
  redraws
* made a few small changes to the main ui, including basic listview headers if
  the window grows large enough

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.5.0

user-facing:

* remember volume and repeat settings across app launches
* improved visualizer quality
* reduced download size by a couple megabytes

low-level:

* optimized Stream and Player communication. more direct, less locking. no more
  weird deferred cleanup
* removed fftw3 dependency in favor of kiss_fft. much smaller download now
* added a proper windowing algorithm to audio samples before they are handed to
  the fft process
* fixed audio de-interleaving issue which lead to funky fft results in some
  cases
* included a new spectrum visualizer sample called GdiVis (win32 only for now)
* overhauled some parts of the audio engine to ensure buffer size is consistent
  during playback. this makes visualization quality better, and should make it
  easier to integrate with things like JACK and PulseAudio.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.4.1

* fixed the transport readout to be more legible
* fixed a crash in NowPlayingLayout when the window became too small
* improved the IPlaybackService and IPlaybackRemote interfaces, and introduced a
  new IRetainedTrack type.
* upgraded build environment to visual studio 2017

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.4.0

* updated transport focus behavior to be less confusing -- it was previously too
  easy to accidentally focus the transport.
* added mute functionality. focus the volume control and press enter or just
  press m while browsing your library.
* added new IPlaybackRemote and IPlaybackService sdk interfaces to support
  writing plugins that can control playback and be notified of playback events.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.3.5

* various small visualizer-related fixes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.3.4

* visualizer support! press v to show the picker! a couple samples (Milkdrop2
  and projectM) are included below. unzip these to your musikbox\plugins
  directory.
* fixed a nasty unicode conversion bug.
* various other small fixes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.2.2

* small improvements to the transport view, including the display of the volume
  percentage next to the volume slider.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.2.1

* initial "public" release
